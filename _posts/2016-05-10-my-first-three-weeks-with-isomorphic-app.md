### The story

During the past few weeks, I've been working on an experiement project which aims to

#### The stack


|                    | Personal preference | Current stack |
| -----------------  | ------------------- | ------------- |
|  View              | yo-yo, bel          | React         |
|  State management  | send-actions        | send-actions  |
|  Date fetching     | restful api, axios  | GraphQL, Relay|
|  Route             | base-router         | react-router  |
|  Assets serving    | browserify          | webpack       |
|  Precompile JS     |                     | Babel         |

* **npm as package manager**(presume nodejs is installed)
* **module bundler** via Webpack or Browserify
* **JavaScript compiler** via Babel
* **Code style check** via tools like `standard`
* **unit test and end to end test** with `tape` or `mocha`

#### CI

#### Staging

#### Production deployment

Our existing architecture

#### Local

* **Bower together with some Ruby gems**
* Assets management with **Sprocket** gem
* **JavaScript compiler** via `coffee-rails` gem
* No code style check at the moment
* **unit test** with `jasmine` and **end to end test** with `Cucumber`

Problem:

* Front-end blocked by Back-end
* Legacy codebase and monolithc architecture

Benefit:

* Reduce monolithc by separate concern of assets management
* Embrace morden Front-end tooling system and best practises
* Catch up and get involved in the Front-end ecosystem
* Developer experience and happiness
