Roughly a year ago, I started to prepare the visa to Australia. Among that time, I did not have clear mind of what I might doing there.

It started with the idea that as a English major, I need to go aboard at some point. And while making the plan for 2015, I didn't set any particular goal but the trip to go aboard.

It's Australia and the main reason behind it is I got a friend there, so the plan is that I could save some money for the hotel and ask someone for help if needed.

I ended up staying at my friend Vigi's couch for two weeks, and it is great(yes, I steal the bed from the cat).

I started the journey on Labor's Day holiday(1st May), and another two weeks after that, so 17 days in total. Here I'd like to thank my company to allow me to leave when we still have a tight schedule for client works.

While choosing the flight to Melbourne, I selected the lowest price flight which took off at Pudong airport and transfer via Hongkong to Melbourne airport, it was totally fine because it's only 1 and half an hour of waiting, I could take a short break during that time.

But the plane was delayed due to traffic control, and by the time I arrived to Hongkong, the other plane has already left. So I have to stay at Hongkong for one night and take the earliest one in the morning.

It was middle night when I were there, and due to the delay, the airline company arranged us a good hotel which located at a fairly "good" location, and it's only 1 and half an hour of taxi. Basically it took me 1 hour to get out of the airport because there's lots of people at that particular night. And after only 3 hours of sleep, I have to get up super early and another 1 hour of taxi to the airport, and I missed the nice looking breakfast there at the hotel.

I still remember the early morning taxi ride to the airport, the air was fresh and sky was blue. I've been to Hongkong twice but did not have the chance to meet the early Hongkong, everything is nice except the taxi driver is not that friendly because I was speaking Mandarin instead of Cantonese.

It was 11PM local time at Melbourne, and it's my first time aboard. Vigi told me it will take sometime for me to find the airport bus, and probably more time to transfer to a train. So I choose to take a taxi at last. It took no effort at all to find a taxi as you could see signs with Chinese everywhere, and of course, Chinese people here and there.

One hour of taxi, and it was AUD $125(around RMB 625) in total! And after that, I was able to enjoy the high living expense there. I've done some comparison before I was there, and while our company choosing the second office outside of China, I've already know that is much more expensive than Shanghai, but is still out of my expectation.

I usually don't have much plan when I go to a new place, so it was after I arrived there, I googled "place worth visiting in Melbourne", and I also checked some Chinese trip advisor website, but turns out I do not like those places. There's always too many people there.

I spend most of my time at Vigi's university library. For me, it has high speed wifi and decent coffee downstairs, so perfect place for coding.

It was the time when I were there, I was able to experience the life of oversea students. Most of them have plenty of free time apart from classes. Usually they will choose to work for local shops or restaurants as part time job. It may not be an idea job, but at least they could get some working experience and some pocket money.

The traffic there is not as convient as Shanghai due to the layout of their houses, usually there's no tall buildings except the centre of the city. Every family have a two floor house with backyard, so the density of population is usually way lower than Shanghai. In this way, it will take sometime for them to go to the nearest supermarket or bus station. In this way, most of the families will own a car, and even for those oversea students.
