title: My Front-end Development Workflow

---

I happened to read the post [Front-End Technology Stack Round-Up](https://medium.com/@rogerdudler/front-end-technology-stack-survey-2014-809f7a8c92f3) on [Medium](https://medium.com) by Roger Dudler.

As for myself, I'm trying to move to another company, and sometimes I need to explain to people the front-end development workflow in my current office. So I decide to write this post, to have a brief summary of how I work in [Wiredcraft](http://wiredcraft.com) as a front-end developer.

It's far from being great, and it's nothing fancy. I just write it down so that sometime later in the future, I know how I work at a certain period of time. In the mean time, to whom that may interest how I work, you should be able to find something here, and I hope it will be helpful to you.

#### Editor / IDE

I'm not a big fan of any kind of IDE. They are often too large in size, and may consume large memory usage. But as a front-end developer, there seems not too much benefit that an IDE could bring me compare to a light weight text editor.

The main editor I use on a daily basis is `Sublime Text`. It's light, fast, yet powerful. I'm not quite good at `Vim`, but I like it. I use it when I need to work on small project, or on environment that without GUI.

#### Version Control System

I believe I'm too young to know any version control system other than **git**.

#### CSS

#### JavaScript

#### JS Framework

#### Package Manager

#### Build System
