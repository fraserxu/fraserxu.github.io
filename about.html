title: About Fraser Xu

Hi, I'm Fraser.

I’m a web developer, a blogger, a translator, and also <del>a student</del>(not anymore since June 2013).

<del>I’m currently studying English Language and Culture at the Huazhong University of Science & Technology Wenhua College.</del>

I'm currently working as a web developer [@WiredCraft](http://wiredcraft.com), and switch myself from back-end to font-end as needed. Here we research and develop with cool techniques mainly in JavaScript such as Nodejs, MV* framework like Angularjs.

I'm a super fan of angularjs as it really makes writing single page application less pain. And also, I integrate tools like Grunt into our project to automate things like unit test, realtime scss file compile, code concat, liveload, etc. It  makes the development and deployment process much more easy.

As for Nodejs, it's just awesome, I think there's no need for me to explain why because it's so popular these days.

While studying English language as my major at college, I like programming language much more and consider myself primarily a web developer. I’ve been learning web development by myself for about 2 years and now I’m having fun playing with JavaScript, HTML5 and CSS3.

I like open source stuffs like ubuntu, vim, git & more and also new web techs such as nodejs, mongodb, rwd.
