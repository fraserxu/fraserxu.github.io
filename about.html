  <h1>About Fraser Xu</h1>
  <p>Hi, I&rsquo;m <strong>Fraser</strong>, I’m a web developer, a blogger, a translator, and also <del>a student</del>(not anymore since June 2013).</p>

  <p>I&rsquo;m currently working as a web developer <a href="http://wiredcraft.com">@WiredCraft</a>, and switching myself from back-end to font-end as needed.</p>

  <p>While studying English language as my major at college, I liked programming language much more and considered myself more of a web developer. I’ve been learning web development by myself for about 2 years and now I’m having fun playing with JavaScript, HTML5 and CSS3.</p>

  <p>Before I graduated from college, I worked as interners in company called <a href="http://geekpark.net">Geekpark</a> where I learnt a lot on product management and UX design, and grow some knowledge standing on a point of prduct manager.</p>

  <p>After I came to wiredcraft which is more of a foreign company where half of the employee including the boss are foreigners, I get a English communication atmosphere which it's exactly what I've been lacking in college as a English major for almost 4 years, and of course now my oral English is much better than the time before I came here. Besides that, what I think more important to my programmer career is how we code.</p>

  <p>And it's here that I know about git, and really start using github(<a href="http://wiredcraft.com/posts/2013/09/18/github-for-everything.html">almost for everything here</a>). After that I enter a better world which is called open source community, where people share their code freely and contribute to each other. Now I'm proudly been part of it.</p>

  <p>Here, we using a lot of cool stuffs. Nodejs for the back-end, Angularjs as the main front-end framework, and xmpp for making realtime applications and even video chat in the browser with WebRTC.</p>

  <p>If you are interested in some of my experience, you can find me on <a href="https://twitter.com/fraserxu">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://github.com/fraserxu">Github</a></p> and <a href="http://weibo.com/xvfeng123">Weibo</a>, or simply drop me an email: xvfeng123 AT gmail DOT com.
